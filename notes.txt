Need to do:
-fix the drag drop specific to turn order after clicking undo 
-sliding pieces must recognize valid movements only up to a certain point where another piece is blocking 
-Implement En passant

Things already done:
already fixed validmovements exceeding the edge of the board when piece is one tile away from edge

for the pawns
-if p/P piece index is == pawnStartingPosition, highlight +2 also
-push the index out of the array after pawn's initial move

for the sliding pieces
-get piece index add continuously to index until edge of board is reached

-figure out how to remove the changing of homeTile value when dragging pieces

-figure out how to disable allow drop for tile illegal moves

-avoid ending color's turn when piece is returned to homeTile

-disable ability to place piece inside <i> element

-initiate snapshot of fen for undo button
