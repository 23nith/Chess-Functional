For move rule
-already fixed valid movements exceeding the edge of the board when piece is one tile away from edge
-sliding pieces must recognize valid movements only up to a certain point where another piece is blocking 

For the pawns

For Dragging
-figure out how to remove the changing of homeTile value when dragging pieces
-figure out how to disable allow drop for tile illegal moves
-fix can't change piece to move once click piece, sometimes you can change a piece but it uses the previous piece move behavior
-Capture will only register when pieces are dragged into the tile beside the other piece being captured but not on top of the other piece.
-Ever since changing the pieces into images there has been a bug that enables users to, at times, drag pieces out of order and this would show highlighted tiles not
corresponding to the piece's valid move. (not happening when svg version of pieces are used).

for Pieces
-avoid ending color's turn when piece is returned to homeTile
-disable ability to place piece inside <i> element
-fix highlighting sometimes not working.

For History
-initiate snapshot of fen for undo button
-fix the drag drop specific to turn order after clicking undo
-let undo track when pieces were captured
